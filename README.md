MultibandHTML5VideoEQ
=====================
This is a small script demonstrating how to feed the HTML-5 video elements audio output to the Web Audio API for further processing. It is fed to a series of filter objects in a graphic EQ configuration to demonstrate.
This is not a library, just a demo script.
Have fun.
